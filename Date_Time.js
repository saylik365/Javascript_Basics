//Js has a already defined API for date but there is a new API called Temporal
// Temporal API is a new API for working with dates and times in JavaScript.
// It provides a more powerful and flexible way to handle dates and times than the existing Date object.
// The Temporal API is designed to be more accurate, easier to use, and more consistent across different time zones and locales.
// The Temporal API is still in development and is not yet fully supported in all browsers.
